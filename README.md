# Talk2PDF

Talk2PDF is a user-friendly application that allows users to interact with their PDF files, enabling them to have a conversation or ask questions about the content. This project leverages the power of OpenAI's language models and embeddings, Pinecone for vector database management, and Streamlit for deployment. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented to ensure better accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversations**: Users can talk to their PDFs, asking questions and receiving detailed responses.
- **High Accuracy**: Implemented Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved accuracy and efficiency.
- **Customizable**: Users can fine-tune the model by adjusting chunk size and chunk overlap.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deployed using Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI API**:
  - **Language Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
  - **Embedding Model**: `text-embedding-ada-002`
- **Pinecone**: Used for vector database management.
- **Streamlit**: Utilized for deploying the application.
